# Caveman [RPG | Survival]
# Unreal Engine 4.7.2 ( C++ )

Caveman is my first attempt in C++, and I wanted the challenge, so I took up the RPG Genre.
The tech demo itself took around a month to build, as I was learning a lot at the time.

Mechanics Built:
- First Person / Third Person Toggle
- RPG Stat System (Health | Stamina | Phys.Damage | Ranged Damage | Armor | Damage Reduction)
- Survival Stat System (Hunger | Heat | Sickness)
- Melee Weapon System
- Ranged Weapon System
- Ammunition Swapping System
- Inventory System
- Crafting System
- Resting System
- Building Fires System
