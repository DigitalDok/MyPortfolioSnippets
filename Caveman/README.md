# Caveman [RPG | Survival]
# Unreal Engine 4.7.2 ( C++ | Blueprints Hybrid)

Caveman is my first attempt in C++, and I wanted the challenge, so I took up the RPG Genre.
The tech demo itself took around a month to build, as I was learning a lot at the time around UE 4.

You control a hungry naked Caveman, and your purpose is to navigate through the level, and kill 5 wolves.
Looting them will give you the meat required to cook a healthy meal to live through the day, provided you find a shelter...
